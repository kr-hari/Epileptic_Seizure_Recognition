## Objective
The aim of this study is to diagnose and identify the type of epileptic seizures by using different machine learning algorithms. 

## Overview
We utilized advanced techniques to analyze EEG signals. Specifically, we extracted the frequency components of the EEG through the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the autoregressive (AR) model-based parametric methods. These extraction methods provided valuable features for the subsequent classification task.

Next, we then employed various machine learning algorithms, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Naive Bayesian, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression to classify and recognize epileptic seizures in the EEG data.

After thorough experimentation and evaluation, we found that k-NN, ANN, and SVM exhibited the highest efficiency in accurately identifying epileptic seizures. This conclusion was drawn from the analysis of both the DWT and AR feature extraction methods. Overall, these findings highlight the significance of employing advanced signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms for effective recognition of epileptic seizures in EEG signals.
