# Epileptic-Seizure-Detection
Epileptic Seizure Detection | Python, Data Visualization | Statistical modeling, Tuning Hyper-parameters
The aim of this study is to diagnose epileptic seizures by using different machine learning algorithms. For this purpose, the frequency components of the EEG are extracted by using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and parametric methods based on autoregressive (AR) model. Both these two feature extraction methods are applied to the input of machine learning classification algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Naive Bayesian, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression,Principal Component Analysis. The results show that k-NN, ANN and SVM were the most efficient method according to test processing of both DWT and AR as feature extraction for recognition of epileptic seizures in EEG.

Developed an LSTM-based model including ARIMA and spectral analysis to classify EEG signals as either seizure or non-seizure to extract features from EEG signals and identify significant changes preceding seizure events.

Dealth with class imbalance through various sampling techniques.

Employed time-frequency analysis techniques such as wavelet transforms and spectrogram analysis to extract meaningful features from EEG signals and trained a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to achieve an accuracy of 93% in detecting epileptic seizures, reducing false alarms by 35%.
