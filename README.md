Developed an LSTM-based model including ARIMA and spectral analysis to classify EEG signals as either seizure or non-seizure to extract features from EEG signals and identify significant changes preceding seizure events.

Dealth with class imbalance through various sampling techniques.

Employed time-frequency analysis techniques such as wavelet transforms and spectrogram analysis to extract meaningful features from EEG signals and trained a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to achieve an accuracy of 93% in detecting epileptic seizures, reducing false alarms by 35%.
